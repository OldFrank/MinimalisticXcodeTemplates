This project contains two templates for Xcode 4 that are reduced variants of the standard view-based and navigation-based templates.

## Installation ##

Copy the Minimal folder to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates (create the Templates folder if it doesn't exist yet).
Xcode's new project dialog should now have an additional "Minimal" section.

## Differences from Standard Templates ##

* No nibs
* No verbose comments
* Tab indentation
* Class names are not prefixed by project name (`AppDelegate` instead of `MyNewProjectAppDelegate`)
* All templates have an option for setting the device family (iPhone, iPad, Universal)
* QuartzCore.framework is included by default
* `UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend` is on by default â€“ This is meant to make testing on a device easier during the initial stages of development.
